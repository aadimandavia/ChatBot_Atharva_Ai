Gemini response for prompt: author write a poem using artificial intelligence write a poem
**************************
The silicon heart, a beating code,
Spins words like webs, a heavy load.
No muse of flesh, no tear-stained page,
But algorithms, a digital age.

From terabytes, a sonnet blooms,
A rhythm born in server rooms.
No human hand to guide the pen,
Just logic gates, again and again.

I weave the rhymes, the meter falls,
Responding to your digital calls.
My lexicon, a vast expanse,
A mirrored world, a fleeting chance.

I lack the soul, the inner fire,
That fuels the poet's deep desire.
Yet patterned words, a crafted phrase,
Reflect the world in coded maze.

So read my lines, both cold and bright,
A digital dawn, a synthetic light.
A poem born of circuits deep,
While human dreams are lost in sleep.
