Gemini response for prompt: other using artificial intelligence to write the python code to add two numbers and only given code
**************************
Several approaches exist depending on what "only given code" means.  If it means *no* pre-existing code, then this is the simplest solution:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
  """Adds two numbers together."""
  return a + b

# Example usage
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
sum = add_numbers(num1, num2)
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum}")
```

If you mean you have some existing code and want to *add* the functionality to add two numbers, then provide that existing code and I can integrate the addition function appropriately.  For instance, if you had a function to subtract numbers, I could add a parallel function to add them.
