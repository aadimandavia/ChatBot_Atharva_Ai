Gemini response for prompt: using artificial intelligence write a code in python to add two numbers
**************************
Several ways exist to add two numbers in Python using AI-assisted techniques (though the AI aspect is mostly in the understanding of the problem and choosing the right approach; the code itself is straightforward). Here are a few examples, demonstrating different levels of sophistication (though the task itself is quite simple):

**Method 1: Basic Addition**

This is the most straightforward approach, directly using the `+` operator.  No AI is really needed here, but it's the foundation:

```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers together.

  Args:
    x: The first number.
    y: The second number.

  Returns:
    The sum of x and y.
  """
  return x + y

# Example usage
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
sum = add_numbers(num1, num2)
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum}")
```

**Method 2:  Handling Different Data Types (AI-influenced)**

A slightly more sophisticated approach would use AI-inspired techniques by considering the possibility of the input not being strictly numbers.  We can add error handling:


```python
def add_numbers_robust(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers together, handling potential errors.

  Args:
    x: The first number (or something that can be converted to a number).
    y: The second number (or something that can be converted to a number).

  Returns:
    The sum of x and y, or an error message if the input is invalid.
  """
  try:
    x = float(x)
    y = float(y)
    return x + y
  except ValueError:
    return "Invalid input: Please provide numbers."

# Example usage
num1 = 10
num2 = "5" #String input
sum = add_numbers_robust(num1, num2)
print(f"The sum is: {sum}")

num3 = "abc"
num4 = 5
sum = add_numbers_robust(num3,num4)
print(f"The sum is: {sum}")
```

**Method 3: Using a Library (for very large numbers, AI relevant for scalability)**


For extremely large numbers that exceed the standard Python integer limits, a library like `decimal` might be necessary. This showcases a scenario where AI might help choose the right tool for the job based on the expected scale of the input:


```python
from decimal import Decimal

def add_large_numbers(x, y):
    """Adds two numbers, handling potentially very large numbers.

    Args:
        x: The first number.
        y: The second number.

    Returns:
        The sum of x and y.
    """
    return Decimal(x) + Decimal(y)


num1 = Decimal("123456789012345678901234567890")
num2 = Decimal("987654321098765432109876543210")
sum = add_large_numbers(num1, num2)
print(f"The sum is: {sum}")
```

In summary, while the core task of adding two numbers is simple, the AI aspect comes into play in designing robust, scalable, and efficient solutions that handle a wider range of inputs and potential issues.  The more complex examples demonstrate this better.
